      <p>The first link will take you to a blog full of ideas for TTRPG settings and worlds written by me that are free to use. The rest of the links are to GitHub pages for the many tools I have put togther while creating the worlds and running TTRPG games.</p>
      <p>If you end up using and enjoying any of these settings and/or tools and feel generous, <a href="https://www.paypal.me/clutteredmind" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tips</a> are much appreciated.</p>
